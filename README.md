## NOTE TO SELF:
remember to enter this in the project main directory:
`./portfolio-project/react-redux-portfolio-project (master) $ npx rails start`
...to boot up the front end and back end servers at once.

## Next Sprint

1.) create a new & separate "Test" component to make sure the React Router
    stuff is working properly.
    a.) create a set of simple links within (and inbetween) the files in them
        "tests" folder

2.) create an "update" fetch for the airframes

3.) Delete unnecessary react icons and simplify App.js

4.) create read actions (index...not show...show will never be used in this app)
    for the other objects bs/ seeing one at a time isn't a thing:
    a.) attitude
    b.) pid
    c.) pluggins

5.) create an "update" action for the other objects:
    a.) attitude
    b.) Pid
    c.) Pluggins
    NOTE: you do not need a "delete" or "create action" for any of these...
    ...you just need to be able to update them

## Completed Tasks

x.) create folder structure in React app based on this workspace:
    https://github.com/Richard-Burd/react-redux-sandbox/tree/master/React-Redux-Tutorials/react-redux-demo

x.) Install all the necessary libraries for a react-redux workspace
    a.) ./portfolio-project/react-redux-portfolio-project/client (master) $ npx install redux react-redux
    b.) ./portfolio-project/react-redux-portfolio-project/client (master) $ npm install react-router-dom
    c.) ./portfolio-project/react-redux-portfolio-project/client (master) $ npm install --save redux-thunk
    d.) ./portfolio-project/react-redux-portfolio-project/client (master) $ npm install redux-logger
    e.) ./portfolio-project/react-redux-portfolio-project/client (master) $ npm install --save redux-devtools-extension

x.) Create the necessary store, action & reducer files needed to fetch astronauts and use them as an example for testing the libraries to make sure they are functioning properly in this workspace

x.) in the delete action for airframes, add the extra code needed to delete
    all of the commensurate data: Pids, Attitude, et. al.

## Instructions for Setting up Backend API for Final Portfolio Project
Instructions are here:
https://www.newline.co/fullstack-react/articles/how-to-get-create-react-app-to-work-with-your-rails-api/

The repo this is based on is here:
https://github.com/fullstackreact/food-lookup-demo-rails


The instructions start at the "Here we go" title

1.) ./portfolio-project (master) $ create-react-app client
      ...this will create a React app called "client"

2.) Create a backend Rails API app in the same directory:
    ./portfolio-project (master) $ rails new server --api
    ...this will create a Rails app called "server"

3.) Go into the backend Rails API app and add the following gem to the Gemfile:
    a.) gem 'foreman', '~> 0.82.0'
    ...then make sure to run bundle install

4.) inside (the main directory of ?) the backend Rails API create a folder called: Procfile

5.) Inside Procfile you need 2 lines of code that look like this:
    ```
    web: cd client && npm start
    api: bundle exec rails s -p 3001
    ```
6.) Inside the Rails app run this command:
    ./portfolio-project/server (master) $ foreman start -p 3000
    ...The client app will boot â€” we can see it running in our browser at
    localhost:3000. And our API server is up and listening at localhost:3001.
    Hitting CTRL+C kills both processes together, humanely.

7.) For our sanity, let's add a Rake task that executes this command for us.
    Create the file ```lib/tasks/start.rake:```
    ```
    task :start do
      exec 'foreman start -p 3000'
    end
    ```
    ...We can now boot the app with:
    ./portfolio-project/server (master) $ rake start
    NOTE: the file is here:
    https://github.com/fullstackreact/food-lookup-demo-rails/blob/master/lib/tasks/start.rake

## Libraries Required for Final Project:
./portfolio-project (master) $ rails new back-end-api --api
./portfolio-project (master) $ npx create-react-app front-end
./portfolio-project/front-end (master) $ npm install --save redux
./portfolio-project/front-end (master) $ npx install redux react-redux
./portfolio-project/front-end (master) $ npm install react-router-dom
./portfolio-project/front-end (master) $ npm install --save redux-thunk
./portfolio-project/front-end (master) $ npm install redux-logger ---- Vishwas method
./portfolio-project/front-end (master) $ npm install axios redux-thunk ---- Vishwas method
./portfolio-project/front-end (master) $ npm i --save redux-logger ---- Some guy
./portfolio-project/front-end (master) $ npm install --save redux-devtools-extension ----Vishwas method
NOTE: this last one is very important and makes the store a lot cleaner because you don't need this big bag verbage if you use it:
"window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__"
